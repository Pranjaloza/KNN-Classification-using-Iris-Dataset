# KNN-Classification-using-Iris-Dataset
This project applies the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify Iris flower species based on their sepal and petal measurements. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Features
- Load and clean the Iris dataset
- Normalize features using StandardScaler
- Train a KNN classifier using Scikit-learn
- Experiment with different values of k (Elbow method)
- Evaluate performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Visualize:
   - Confusion matrix
   - Error rate vs. K value
   - Decision boundaries in 2D

##  Dataset
- Iris.csv

## Tools: 
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
